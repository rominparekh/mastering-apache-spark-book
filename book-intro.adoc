== Mastering Apache Spark 2

Welcome to Mastering Apache Spark 2 (aka #SparkLikePro)!

I'm https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski[Jacek Laskowski], an *independent consultant* who is passionate about *Apache Spark*, Apache Kafka, Scala, sbt (with some flavour of Apache Mesos, Hadoop YARN, and DC/OS). I lead http://www.meetup.com/WarsawScala/[Warsaw Scala Enthusiasts] and http://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Spark[Warsaw Spark] meetups in Warsaw, Poland.

Contact me at jacek@japila.pl or https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to discuss Apache Spark opportunities, e.g. courses, workshops, mentoring or application development services.

If you like the Apache Spark notes you should seriously consider participating in my own, very hands-on https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop/blob/gh-pages/slides/README.md#toc[Spark Workshops].

This collections of notes (what some may rashly call a "book") serves as the ultimate place of mine to collect all the nuts and bolts of using https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark]. The notes aim to help me designing and developing better products with Apache Spark. It is also a viable proof of my understanding of Apache Spark. I do eventually want to reach the highest level of mastery in Apache Spark.

The collection of notes serves as *the study material* for my trainings, workshops, videos and courses about Apache Spark. Follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski[@jaceklaskowski] to know it early. You will also learn about the upcoming events about Apache Spark.

Expect text and code snippets from http://spark.apache.org/community.html[Spark's mailing lists], http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/[the official documentation of Apache Spark], http://stackoverflow.com/tags/apache-spark/info[StackOverflow], blog posts, http://search.oreilly.com/?q=learning+spark[books from O'Reilly], press releases, YouTube/Vimeo videos, http://www.quora.com/Apache-Spark[Quora], https://github.com/apache/spark[the source code of Apache Spark], etc. Attribution follows.
