== [[BroadcastFactory]] BroadcastFactory -- Pluggable Broadcast Variable Factories

`BroadcastFactory` is the interface for factories of link:spark-broadcast.adoc[broadcast variables] in Spark.

NOTE: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12588[As of Spark 2.0], it is no longer possible to plug a custom `BroadcastFactory` in, and link:spark-TorrentBroadcastFactory.adoc[TorrentBroadcastFactory] is the only implementation.

`BroadcastFactory` is exclusively used and instantiated inside of link:spark-service-broadcastmanager.adoc[BroadcastManager].
