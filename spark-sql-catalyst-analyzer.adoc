== [[Analyzer]] Logical Query Plan Analyzer

`Analyzer` is a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical query plan] analyzer. It resolves unresolved attributes and relations to typed objects using information in a link:spark-sql-SessionCatalog.adoc[SessionCatalog] and `FunctionRegistry`.

`Analyzer` is available at runtime through link:spark-sql-sessionstate.adoc#analyzer[analyzer attribute] of the current `SparkSession`.

[source, scala]
----
sparkSession.sessionState.analyzer
----

NOTE: link:spark-sql-sparksession.adoc#sessionState[`sessionState` attribute in `SparkSession`] is a `private[sql]` value so to access it your code has to be in `org.apache.spark.sql` package.

`Analyzer` is a <<RuleExecutor, RuleExecutor>> with link:spark-sql-catalyst-analyzer-CheckAnalysis.adoc[CheckAnalysis] and defines `Substitution`, `Resolution`, `Nondeterministic`, `UDF`, `FixNullability`, and `Cleanup` <<batch, batches of rules>> to apply to a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan].

`Analyzer` uses a link:spark-sql-SessionCatalog.adoc[SessionCatalog], a `CatalystConf`, and a configurable number of iterations (as `maxIterations`).

`Analyzer` defines `extendedResolutionRules` attribute being a collection of rules (that process a `LogicalPlan`) as an extension point that a custom `Analyzer` can use to extend the `Resolution` batch. The collection of rules is added at the end of the `Resolution` batch.

You can access the result of executing `Analyzer` against the link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan] of a link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc[Dataset] using link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc#explain[explain] method or link:spark-sql-query-execution.adoc[QueryExecution]:

[source, scala]
----
val dataset = spark.range(5).withColumn("new_column", 'id + 5 as "plus5")

scala> dataset.explain(extended = true)
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
'Project [*, ('id + 5) AS plus5#148 AS new_column#149]
+- Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(8))

[TIP]
====
Enable `TRACE` or `DEBUG` logging level for `pass:[org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionState$$anon$1]` (when link:spark-sql-sparksession.adoc#enableHiveSupport[Hive support is enabled]) or `pass:[org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SessionState$$anon$1]` logger to see what happens inside `Analyzer`.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
# when Hive support is enabled
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionState$$anon$1=TRACE

# with no Hive support
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SessionState$$anon$1=TRACE
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
---

The reason for such a weird-looking logger name is that `analyzer` attribute is created as an anonymous subclass of `Analyzer` class.

=== [[RuleExecutor]] RuleExecutor -- Abstract Rule Executor

`RuleExecutor` can <<execute, apply>> collection of <<rule, optimization rules>> (as <<batch, batches>>) to a plan tree.

NOTE: The plan tree can be link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan] or link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical plan].

Scala-wise, `RuleExecutor` is an abstract type constructor parameterized by the `TreeType` type parameter.

[source, scala]
----
abstract class RuleExecutor[TreeType <: TreeNode[_]]
----

`RuleExecutor` defines the protected `batches` method that implementations are supposed to define with the collection of <<batch, Batch>> instances to <<execute, execute>>.

[source, scala]
----
protected def batches: Seq[Batch]
----

==== [[execute]] Applying Rules to Tree -- `execute` Method

[source, scala]
----
execute(plan: TreeType): TreeType
----

`execute` iterates over <<batch, batches>> and applies <<rule, rules>> sequentially to the input `plan`.

It tracks the number of iterations and the time of executing each rule (with a plan).

When a rule changes a plan, you should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE HiveSessionState$$anon$1:
=== Applying Rule [ruleName] ===
[currentAndModifiedPlansSideBySide]
```

After the number of iterations has reached the number of iterations for the batch's `Strategy` it stops execution and prints out the following WARN message to the logs:

```
WARN HiveSessionState$$anon$1: Max iterations ([iteration]) reached for batch [batchName]
```

When the plan has not changed (after applying rules), you should see the following TRACE message in the logs and `execute` moves on to applying the rules in the next batch. The moment is called *fixed point* (i.e. when the execution *converges*).

```
TRACE HiveSessionState$$anon$1: Fixed point reached for batch [batchName] after [iteration] iterations.
```

After the batch finishes, if the plan has been changed by the rules, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG HiveSessionState$$anon$1:
=== Result of Batch [batchName] ===
[currentAndModifiedPlansSideBySide]
```

Otherwise, when the rules had no changes to a plan, you should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE HiveSessionState$$anon$1: Batch [batchName] has no effect.
```

=== [[batch]] Batch -- Collection of Optimization Rules

A *batch* in Catalyst is a named collection of <<rule, optimization rules>> with a strategy, e.g.

[source, scala]
----
Batch("Substitution", fixedPoint,
  CTESubstitution,
  WindowsSubstitution,
  EliminateUnions,
  new SubstituteUnresolvedOrdinals(conf)),
----

A `Strategy` can be `Once` or `FixedPoint` (with a number of iterations).

NOTE: `Once` strategy is a `FixedPoint` strategy with one iteration.

=== [[rule]][[Rule]] `Rule`

A *rule* in Catalyst is a named optimization that can be applied to a plan tree.

`Rule` abstract class defines `ruleName` attribute and a single method `apply`:

[source, scala]
----
apply(plan: TreeType): TreeType
----

NOTE: `TreeType` is the type of the plan tree that a rule works with, e.g. link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan], link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] or link:spark-sql-catalyst-Expression.adoc[Expression].
