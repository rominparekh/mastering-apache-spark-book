== [[QueryExecution]] Query Execution

`QueryExecution` is an integral part of a link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc[Dataset] and represents the query execution that will eventually "produce" the data in a `Dataset` (when <<toRDD, toRdd>> is called and a `RDD[InternalRow]` is computed).

NOTE: `QueryExecution` is a transient feature of a link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc[Dataset], i.e. it is not preserved across serializations.

You can access the `QueryExecution` of a `Dataset` using link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc#queryExecution[queryExecution] attribute.

[source, scala]
----
val ds: Dataset[Long] = ...
val queryExec = ds.queryExecution
----

`QueryExecution` is the result of link:spark-sql-sessionstate.adoc#executePlan[executing a `LogicalPlan` in a `SparkSession`] (and so you could create a `Dataset` from a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical operator] or use the `QueryExecution` after executing a logical operator).

.`QueryExecution` Lazy Attributes
[cols="1,3",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Attribute | Description
| [[analyzed]] `analyzed` | Result of applying the link:spark-sql-catalyst-analyzer.adoc[Analyzer]'s rules to the link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan] (of the `QueryExecution`).

| [[withCachedData]] `withCachedData` | `LogicalPlan` that is the `analyzed` plan after being analyzed, checked (for unsupported operations) and replaced with cached segments.

| [[optimizedPlan]] `optimizedPlan` | `LogicalPlan` (of a structured query) being the result of executing the session-owned link:spark-sql-sessionstate.adoc#optimizer[Catalyst Query Optimizer] to <<withCachedData, withCachedData>>.

| [[sparkPlan]] `sparkPlan` | link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] that is the result of requesting link:spark-sql-SparkPlanner.adoc[SparkPlanner] to plan a <<optimizedPlan, optimized logical query plan>>.

NOTE: In fact, the result `SparkPlan` is the first Spark query plan from the collection of possible query plans from link:spark-sql-SparkPlanner.adoc[SparkPlanner].

| [[executedPlan]] `executedPlan` | link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] ready for execution. It is the <<sparkPlan, sparkPlan>> plan with all the <<preparations, preparation rules>> applied.

| [[toRdd]] `toRdd` | `RDD[InternalRow]` that is the result of "executing" a <<executedPlan, physical plan>>, i.e. `executedPlan.execute()`.

TIP: link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[InternalRow] is the internal optimized binary row format.
|===

You can access the lazy attributes as follows:

[source, scala]
----
val dataset: Dataset[Long] = ...
dataset.queryExecution.executedPlan
----

`QueryExecution` uses the input `SparkSession` to access the current link:spark-sql-SparkPlanner.adoc[SparkPlanner] (through link:spark-sql-sessionstate.adoc[SessionState] that could also return a link:spark-sql-queryplanner.adoc#HiveSessionState[HiveSessionState]) when <<creating-instance, it is created>>. It then computes a link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] (a `PhysicalPlan` exactly) using the planner. It is available as the <<sparkPlan, `sparkPlan` attribute>>.

A streaming variant of `QueryExecution` is <<IncrementalExecution, IncrementalExecution>>.

TIP: Use link:spark-sql-dataset-operators.adoc#explain[`explain` operator] to know about the logical and physical plans of a `Dataset`.

[source, scala]
----
val ds = spark.range(5)
scala> ds.queryExecution
res17: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecution =
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
Range 0, 5, 1, 8, [id#39L]

== Analyzed Logical Plan ==
id: bigint
Range 0, 5, 1, 8, [id#39L]

== Optimized Logical Plan ==
Range 0, 5, 1, 8, [id#39L]

== Physical Plan ==
WholeStageCodegen
:  +- Range 0, 1, 8, 5, [id#39L]
----

CAUTION: FIXME What's `planner`? `analyzed`? Why do we need `assertSupported`?

`QueryExecution` belongs to `org.apache.spark.sql.execution` package.

=== [[hiveResultString]] `hiveResultString` Method

[source, scala]
----
hiveResultString(): Seq[String]
----

`hiveResultString` returns the result as a Hive-compatible sequence of strings.

[source, scala]
----
scala> spark.range(5).queryExecution.hiveResultString
res0: Seq[String] = ArrayBuffer(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> spark.read.csv("people.csv").queryExecution.hiveResultString
res4: Seq[String] = ArrayBuffer(id	name	age, 0	Jacek	42)
----

CAUTION: FIXME

Internally, `hiveResultString` does..

NOTE: `hiveResultString` is executed when...

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating `QueryExecution` Instance

[source, scala]
----
class QueryExecution(
  val sparkSession: SparkSession,
  val logical: LogicalPlan)
----

`QueryExecution` requires a link:spark-sql-sparksession.adoc[SparkSession] and a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan].

=== [[planner]] Accessing `SparkPlanner` -- `planner` Method

[source, scala]
----
planner: SparkPlanner
----

`planner` returns the current link:spark-sql-SparkPlanner.adoc[SparkPlanner].

`planner` is merely to expose internal link:spark-sql-sessionstate.adoc#planner[planner] (in the current link:spark-sql-sessionstate.adoc[SessionState]).

=== [[preparations]] `preparations` -- `SparkPlan` Preparation Rules (to apply before Query Execution)

`preparations` is a sequence of link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] optimization rules.

TIP: A `SparkPlan` optimization rule transforms a link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical operator] (aka `SparkPlan`) to another (possibly more efficient)  `SparkPlan`.

`preparations` collection is an intermediate phase of query execution that developers can used to introduce further optimizations.

The current list of `SparkPlan` transformations in `preparations` is as follows:

1. `ExtractPythonUDFs`
2. `PlanSubqueries`
3. link:spark-sql-EnsureRequirements.adoc[EnsureRequirements]
4. `CollapseCodegenStages`
5. `ReuseExchange`
6. `ReuseSubquery`

NOTE: The transformation rules are applied sequentially in order to the physical plan before execution, i.e. they generate a `SparkPlan` when <<executedPlan, executedPlan>> lazy value is accessed.

=== [[IncrementalExecution]] IncrementalExecution

`IncrementalExecution` is a custom `QueryExecution` with `OutputMode`, `checkpointLocation`, and `currentBatchId`.

It lives in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming` package.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `stateStrategy`?

Stateful operators in the query plan are numbered using `operatorId` that starts with `0`.

`IncrementalExecution` adds one `Rule[SparkPlan]` called `state` to <<preparations, preparations>> sequence of rules as the first element.

CAUTION: FIXME What does `IncrementalExecution` do? Where is it used?
