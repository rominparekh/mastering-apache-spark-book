== [[RpcEndpoint]] RpcEndpoint

`RpcEndpoint` defines a RPC endpoint that processes *messages* using *callbacks*, i.e. *functions* to execute when a message arrives.

`RpcEndpoint` lives in link:spark-rpc.adoc[RpcEnv] after being registered by a name.

A RpcEndpoint can be registered to one and only one RpcEnv.

The lifecycle of a RpcEndpoint is `onStart`, `receive` and `onStop` in sequence.

`receive` can be called concurrently.

TIP: If you want `receive` to be thread-safe, use link:spark-rpc.adoc#ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint[ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint].

`onError` method is called for any exception thrown.
