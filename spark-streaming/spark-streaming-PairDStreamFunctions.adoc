`reduceByKeyAndWindow` returns a `ReducedWindowedDStream` with the input `reduceFunc`, `invReduceFunc` and `filterFunc` functions link:../spark-sparkcontext.adoc#clean[cleaned up].

TIP: Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.ReducedWindowedDStream` to see the times for window, slide, zero with current and previous windows in the logs.
