== ReceivedBlockHandlers

`ReceivedBlockHandler` represents how to handle the storage of blocks received by link:spark-streaming-receivers.adoc[receivers].

NOTE: It is used by link:spark-streaming-receiversupervisors.adoc#ReceiverSupervisorImpl[ReceiverSupervisorImpl] (as the internal link:spark-streaming-receiversupervisors.adoc#ReceiverSupervisorImpl-receivedBlockHandler[receivedBlockHandler]).

=== [[contract]] ReceivedBlockHandler Contract

`ReceivedBlockHandler` is a `private[streaming] trait`. It comes with two methods:

* `storeBlock(blockId: StreamBlockId, receivedBlock: ReceivedBlock): ReceivedBlockStoreResult` to store a received block as `blockId`.
* `cleanupOldBlocks(threshTime: Long)` to clean up blocks older than `threshTime`.

NOTE: `cleanupOldBlocks` implies that there is a relation between blocks and the time they arrived.

=== [[implementations]] Implementations of ReceivedBlockHandler Contract

There are two implementations of `ReceivedBlockHandler` contract:

* `BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler` that stores received blocks in Spark's link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager] with the specified link:../spark-rdd-StorageLevel.adoc[StorageLevel].
+
Read <<BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler, BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler>> in this document.

* `WriteAheadLogBasedBlockHandler` that stores received blocks in a write ahead log and Spark's link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager]. It is a more advanced option comparing to a simpler <<BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler, BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler>>.

==== [[BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler]] BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler

`BlockManagerBasedBlockHandler` is the default `ReceivedBlockHandler` in Spark Streaming.

It uses link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager] and a receiver's link:../spark-rdd-StorageLevel.adoc[StorageLevel].

`cleanupOldBlocks` is not used as blocks are cleared by _some other means_ (FIXME)

`putResult` returns `BlockManagerBasedStoreResult`. It uses `BlockManager.putIterator` to store `ReceivedBlock`.

==== [[WriteAheadLogBasedBlockHandler]] WriteAheadLogBasedBlockHandler

`WriteAheadLogBasedBlockHandler` is used when link:spark-streaming-settings.adoc[spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable] is `true`.

It uses link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[BlockManager], a receiver's `streamId` and link:../spark-rdd-StorageLevel.adoc[StorageLevel], link:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf] for additional link:spark-streaming-settings.adoc[configuration settings], Hadoop Configuration, the checkpoint directory.
