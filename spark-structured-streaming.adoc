== Spark Structured Streaming -- Streaming Datasets

*Structured Streaming* is a new computation model introduced in Spark 2.0 for building end-to-end streaming applications termed as *continuous applications*. Structured streaming offers a high-level declarative streaming API built on top of link:spark-sql-dataset.adoc[Datasets] (inside Spark SQL's engine) for link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc[continuous incremental execution of structured queries].
